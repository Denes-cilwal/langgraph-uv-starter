# ✅ Solution: Agentic Chatbots (How They Solve the Remaining Problems)

Tool-augmented chatbots can **take actions**, but they still stay **reactive**, have **no workflow memory**, and **can’t adapt**.
The solution is an **Agentic Chatbot**: a chatbot that can **plan, remember, decide, act, and learn**.

## 🧠 What is an Agentic Chatbot?

An **Agentic Chatbot** is an LLM system enhanced with:

- **Planner** (decides what to do next)
- **Memory** (remembers decisions and workflow state)
- **Tools** (executes actions via APIs)
- **RAG** (retrieves company knowledge)
- **Feedback loop** (learns from results and adapts)

## ❗ Problems It Solves

### 1) Reactive ❌ → ✅ Proactive

**Agentic bots** don’t wait for prompts only.  
They follow a plan and can trigger next actions based on events (e.g., new applications arriving).

### 2) No Memory ❌ → ✅ Workflow Memory + Long-Term Memory

The agent stores:

- current hiring stage (JD done, posting done, shortlisting pending…)
- candidate statuses
- decisions taken (salary range chosen, interview panel decided…)

### 3) Can’t Adapt ❌ → ✅ Learns and Adjusts Strategy

The agent checks outcomes and changes behavior:

- low applicant quality → change job platforms / modify JD
- offer rejection → suggest salary band update / improve offer messaging
