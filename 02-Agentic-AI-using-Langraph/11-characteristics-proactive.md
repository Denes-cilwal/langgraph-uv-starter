# 🔄 Proactive Behavior: Agentic AI vs Generative AI

## 📌 Proactivity in Agentic AI

**Agentic AI is proactive**, meaning it continuously monitors outcomes, evaluates progress toward a goal, and **takes corrective actions autonomously**—without waiting for user instructions.

---

## 🎯 Example: Job Posting Monitoring

### Scenario

- The Agentic AI posts a **Backend Engineer** job on LinkedIn.
- The AI assumes responsibility for achieving the hiring goal.

### Continuous Monitoring

The Agentic AI continuously tracks key performance signals such as:

- Number of applications received
- Application growth rate per day
- Candidate quality and relevance

---

## ⏱️ Detection of Issues

After **3 days**, the Agentic AI identifies:

- A low number of applicants
- Slower-than-expected application growth

From this data, the AI determines that the **current hiring strategy is ineffective**.

---

## ⚙️ Automatic Adjustments by Agentic AI

Without requiring any user input, the Agentic AI may automatically:

- Rewrite the job description to be more engaging
- Adjust _required_ vs _preferred_ skill criteria
- Modify the job title  
  _(e.g., “Backend Engineer” → “Backend Software Engineer”)_
- Increase visibility by reposting or boosting the job
- Expand location options or enable remote work
- Publish the job on additional platforms

This process repeats in a **continuous feedback loop** until hiring metrics show positive progress.

---

### 👉 Key Takeaway

**Agentic AI detects failure, reasons about it, and acts autonomously to achieve the goal.**

---

## 🧠 Behavior of Generative AI (Non-Agentic)

In contrast, **Generative AI is reactive** and operates only when explicitly prompted by a user.

---

## 📝 Using the Same Scenario

### What Generative AI _Can_ Do

- Write a job description
- Suggest improvements _when asked_
- Rewrite the job posting on request

### What Generative AI _Cannot_ Do

- Monitor application metrics
- Determine whether performance is poor
- Take corrective action autonomously
- Track progress over time
- Own the hiring goal

---

## 📍 Example Interaction

### User Prompt

### Generative AI Response

- Produces an improved job description
- Stops execution immediately afterward

There is **no monitoring, reasoning, or follow-up action**.

---

### 👉 Key Takeaway

**Generative AI responds to instructions, but it does not own the goal.**
