# 🤖 Agentic AI Chatbot for HR Recruitment

## 📌 Overview

This project explains how an **Agentic AI Chatbot** works in an **HR recruitment scenario**.  
Unlike traditional chatbots that respond to a single question, an agentic AI system understands **high-level goals**, creates a plan, and executes that plan autonomously over time.

## 🎯 What Is Agentic AI?

Agentic AI refers to an AI system that:

- Understands **goals**, not just tasks
- Converts goals into **structured plans**
- Executes actions autonomously
- Adapts based on feedback and new information

- **Responsibility:** Manage the full hiring lifecycle

The AI assumes ownership without requiring further instructions.

5. Shortlist candidates
6. Schedule and manage interviews
7. Collect interview feedback
